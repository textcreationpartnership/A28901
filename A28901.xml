            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:103743:4"/> The ſad evidences of this deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ignorance I my ſelf have found in not a few of that Congregation and County, (where above twenty years I lived a Preacher of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, a preſſer and Practizer of this Duty of Catechizing) and where I met ſuch ignorance,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.1.</note> as is not fit to be named amongſt Chriſtians: One affirming blindely (upon Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) That none had died for him, nor ſhould any die for him, he would ſtand between God and himſelf; yet after when I told him that Chriſt died for him, he wept for joy. Another, That the Sun ſhining in the Firmament was the Son of God that died for him. A third averring, There was no hell, and that her ſoul ſhould go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven like a white Dove (although ſhe did not know the way to Heaven: other hoped to be ſaved by our <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:</hi> And multitudes ignorant of the knowledge and light of Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:103743:5"/> in any competent meaſure to meet Chriſt in the Sacrament, or to walk comfortably with Chriſt in their lives, or indeed neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And the woful effects of this blinde Popiſh ignorance, I my ſelf have found by ſorrowful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence alſo; and that almoſt in the beginning of our Engliſh Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles (this lamentable Civil War) The Kings Majeſty no ſooner ſet up His Royal Standard at <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham</hi> (within twenty miles of my Habitation) but divers of theſe blinde, ignorant, prophane, and Popiſhly affected, of the baſer ſort (I ſpeak nothing of the Superiours) they prepare for War, make haſte towards the Standard; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the ROUND-HEADS (a name they quickly learned) were threatned with Plundring, Fire and Sword; my ſelf, with divers other well-affected to Religion, the Kings
<pb facs="tcp:103743:5"/> Majeſty, Parliament and Kingdom, were conſtrained to flie our houſes, from whence, ever ſince, I have lived a baniſhed man, theſe having not yet been for any ſpace of time, either ſafe or comfortable abiding.</p>
            <p>And if was not long after that, but by ſuch like Popiſh ignorant Souldiers, and in particular, by a Commander in the Earl of <hi>New-caſtles</hi> Army, a Papiſt (ſince dead) I was Plundred, not only of my Goods and Study of Books, above twenty years in gathering, and my houſe Barbarouſly torn in pieces &amp; ſpoiled, ſtanding to this day a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle to witneſſe truth (to the ſhame of blinde, ignorant, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, and Popiſh malice of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Enemies) I am ſure to my loſſe of more Hundreds of pounds then for preſent I am willing to glory in. But which was worſe,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.34.</note> my Manuſcripts, near thirty years Studies and pains night and day,
<pb facs="tcp:103743:6"/> rent in pieces and taken away, the greateſt part then, and the reſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from a Garriſon of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">W. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or.</note> taken by the ſame Earl of <hi>Newcaſtles</hi> Army. And for all my loſſes (beſides what will be due to me upon the Publike Faith) I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no recompence but from the Lord, except it pleaſe God to ſetle the Kingdom in Truth and Peace; and to enable Your Honorable Houſes of Parliament, according to Your Religious Declarations, to take notice of my loſſes, as of others my Brethren and Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the ſame Tribulations (Your faithful Friends) and to direct a way of Reparation, as to Your Wiſdoms and Piety ſhall ſeem moſt convenient. That Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Both Kingdoms, although I cannot ſay it was an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto me, becauſe I had loſt all before; yet I may ſay it was a a ground of comfort in faith and
<pb facs="tcp:103743:6"/> hope, that the Lord would work mightily for theſe Kingdoms, and ſo there might be ſome expectation of outward good, and Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion again in Gods due time to me or mine. (I muſt beg pardon for this digreſſion).</p>
            <p>And yet this I cannot but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 4.1, 2. Prov. 29.18.</note> That I am aſſured this abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, blinde, prophane, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious ignorance (not only in that, but in other parts of the Kingdom) was one principal occaſion of theſe and the like ſad miſeries, both to me and many Thouſands in the Land;<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.1, 2, 3.</note> eſpecially the Religious part, who have commonly been the objects of the Malice and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine of theſe ignorant, prophane, or Popiſh perſons (beſides their oppreſſions by other men, not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly affected).</p>
            <p>Now, if Your Honours ask me, What hath been or is the cauſe of this ignorance? In all humility
<pb facs="tcp:103743:7"/> I Anſwer from my own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I am certain a principal cauſe was and is want of Catechizing:<note place="margin">Acts 20 22.</note> Firſt, by Miniſters in their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Congregations: And ſecondly, by Parents and Maſters in their particular Families,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.18, 19.</note> without which I conceive it impoſſible to cure this deadly Malady of baſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or ever to have the common ſort of people know how to ſerve or obey either God or man,<note place="margin">Iſa. 27.11. &amp; 29.11, 12.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the light of Chriſt, and good Laws Eſtabliſhed in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: As the <hi>Eunuch</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Philip,</hi>

               <p>Queſt. 13. <hi>But doth not the Sacrament hold forth Chriſt crucified to the eyes, as well as Preaching of the Goſpel doth to the eares; And may not a man be converted to the faith of Chriſt by the Sacrament, as well as by the Word Preached?

               <p>Secondly, I do acknowledge that the Lord may &amp; can if he pleaſe convert a wicked, blinde, ignorant, prophane man or woman, by ſeeing the Bread broken, and the Wine powred out, and eſpecially by thoſe manifeſtations of Chriſts Death and Paſsion, and thoſe Dehortations and Admonitions of Ignorant and prophane, ſcandalous men and women to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, and not preſume to come to the Lords Table, untill God give them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; And by thoſe invitations of believing, humble, hungry, repenting ſouls to draw nigh to meet Chriſt, and feaſt with him at his Table, and this by the power of the Spirit of Chriſt, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all home to the ſoul. But it is the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel in another manner then at the Sacrament, that is, the common and ordinary way of converſion, in which men and women ought to wait upon

               <p>Queſt. 5. <hi>But how can the Son of God be ſaid to be begotten of God the Father, ſince God the Father is a Spirituall Eſſence; and can one Spirit be ſaid to beget another, or how might this be?</hi>

               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:103743:83"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a great myſtery, more fit for Faith to believe, then Reaſon to apprehend, nor do I know any ſimilitude can truly and fully expreſſe this myſtery; but the learned endeavoring to give ſome light of it, have held forth the eternall generation of the Son of God, in theſe and the like expreſſions: Firſt, as the minde of a man when it thinketh of, and underſtands it ſelf, by reflection upon it ſelf, doth form and beget in it ſelf, and as it were of it ſelf, ſome Image or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it ſelf, (though not perfect or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, of it ſelf ſubſiſting:) So God the Father, when as he fully knoweth and beholdeth himſelf in his Eternity and infinity. After an unutterable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he did beget in himſelf the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Image, and expreſſe likeneſſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, diſtinctly ſubſiſting, and yet wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully co-eſſentiall with himſelf from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and to this effect Chriſt is called the brightneſſe of Gods glory,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> and the expreſſe Image of his perſon,<note place="margin">Col. 1.15</note> and of the inviſible God, and the like in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Secondly, As a word is the Image of the minde,<note place="margin">Iohn 1.1, 2.</note> and begotten of the minde, ſo the eſſentiall word is the Image of God the Father.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:103743:83"/>
               <p>Thirdly, not far different from this, others expreſſe it thus, That as a man looking his naturall face in a glaſſe, doth beget his own image or likeneſſe, which ſo long as he looketh, continueth as his own expreſſe image, (though that is not ſubſiſting by it ſelf:) So God the Father beholding himſelf from all Eternity, in the eternall glaſſe of his own moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Eſſence, he did eternally, or from all eternity, beget his own Son, his own expreſſe image, as noted before: And this Perſon of the Son, is a Perſon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting by himſelf, and diſtinguiſhed from God the Father, and yet of one Eſſence with the Father, and the holy Spirit bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever. But this great myſtery is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be admired and glorified, then by weak men to be ſearched into or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. And in like manner the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the holy Ghoſt, the third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Trinity, is admirable and unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the Sons of men.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 6. <hi>But if God the Son, this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon of the Trinity, who took our nature upon him, was begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: How can he be God from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity equall with the Father; was not God the Father before God the Son?</hi>

               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:103743:84"/>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In this Trinity none is afore or after another, but all three Perſons co-eternall together, and co-equall, as was noted before in the ſecond Claſſis, <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion</hi> the twenty one.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 7. <hi>But how may this in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be conceived?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is to be believed, though our humane reaſon cannot comprehend it, ſince the Scriptures hold forth ſufficient grounds for it: and certainly ſimilitudes drawn from the creatures or things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, cannot fully expreſſe it; yet you may conceive ſome reſemblance of a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of ſuch a truth, even from ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things daily in our ſight. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, when you light a Candle, no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is the Candle lighted, but at the ſame moment of time, there is a glorious Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, there is light, and there is heat or warmth, and none of theſe is afore or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, but all equall in time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The like may be obſerved of the Sun in the Firmament, and other things: And ſo howſoever the Father in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of order of perſons, may be before the Son; yet in order of time, I believe they are co-eternall and co-equall for ever, and before all time whatſoever.</p>

It hath ſufficient authority to be commended as a Truth of Chriſt, for the benefit of Chriſts Church, and may hold good for ſubſtance in the New Teſtament, as well as in the Old; although in a different manner of diſpenſation: And therefore thoſe who caſt off a Truth of Chriſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth in the Old Teſtament, becauſe it is not in ſo many words, held forth or expreſſed in the New, I conceive, do much derogate from Chriſt, who was the glorious Prophet of his Church, as truly in the Old Teſtament, as in the New.

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, you may take notice of this which followeth, Whatſoever was a poſitive rule and inſtitution of Chriſt to a beleever as a beleever, either concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf or his children, as children of a beleever, for aſſurance of ſalvation by Faith in Chriſt, and inward Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the heart, according to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace in the Old Teſtament, which is ho way revoked in the New: That is, ſtill a poſitive rule and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt virtually, and in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it, to a beleever as a beleever; and to, or concerning the children of a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103743:115"/> beleever as children of a beleever, and to be continued now in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a duty, by vertue of that Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Chriſt, as well as in the Old, or before the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh. But a ſigne and ſeal of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of faith, and ſalvation in Chriſt, and of Circumciſion made without hands, or of Spiritual Regeneration of the heart, and life; and aſſurance of theſe was a poſitive command and inſtitution of Chriſt to a beleever as a beleever, and to, or concerning the children of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever as children of a beleever, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the covenant of Grace in the Old Teſtament, and is no way forbidden in the New Teſtament; and therefore a ſigne and ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of faith, and of ſalvation in Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, or inward circumciſion of the heart, according to the covenant of Grace, is ſtill a poſitive rule and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt vertually in, or for the ſubſtance of it, to a beleever as to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, and to, or concerning the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of a beleever as children of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, and to be continued now in the New Teſtament as a duty, by vertue of that Inſtitution of Chriſt, as well as it

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> For the firſt Propoſition, it may be confirmed from this ground,<note place="margin">Revel. 13.8. Heb. 13.8.</note> That Chriſt is the ſame Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the World; and Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The ſame Saviour and Mediator, High Prieſt, Prophet, and King of his Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſame Revealer of the Covenant of Grace, as Prophet; and in the ſame manner in reſpect of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.1, 2, 3, 4.</note> Salvation by Chriſt, and ſignes and ſeals of it, as ſignifying and ſealing the ſame inward Graces in the Old Teſtament, and in the New, although by different ſignes and ſeals: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what was inſtituted by Chriſt then to a beleever as a beleever, and no way forbidden or revoked in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment expreſly, nor by good conſequence may be continued to beleevers, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of beleevers in the New Teſtament, as well as in the Old.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Again, for the ſecond, the minor Propoſition or Aſſumption. Firſt, That a ſigne and ſeal of the Righteouſneſſe of Faith, and inward Circumciſion or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation of the heart, was inſtituted by Chriſt to a beleever as a beleever, and to children of a beleever, as children of a beleever. I conceive, this is evident in that example of beleeving <hi>Abraham.</hi> In the renewing of the Covenant of Grace to beleeving <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 19.3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Rom. 4.11.</note> and his ſpiritual Seed, and Chriſts appointing of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, not onely to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, as a ſeal of the covenant of Grace and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Faith, but to his children at eight dayes old. And a ſigne and ſeal was ſtill appointed to beleevers in the New Teſtament, though not the ſame ſigne of circumciſion, yet Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>And although Infants,<note place="margin">Matth. 28.19, 20. Matth. 26. 1 Cor. 11.26, 27.</note> children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, are not named in the Inſtitution in the New Teſtament, as they were in the Old to <hi>Abraham;</hi> yet they are not prohibited, and may virtually be included in the general Inſtitution of baptiſm, as well as women, not named, are virtually included in the Inſtitution of the Lords Supper: And ſo children of beleevers nay be baptized now in their infancy, as
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:103743:117"/> well as children were circumciſed then at eight dayes old, by Chriſts his Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and appointment to <hi>Abraham</hi> a beleever.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 6. <hi>But how doth it appear, that the Lord did renew the Covenant of Grace to</hi> Abraham <hi>a beleever as a beleever, and appointed a circumciſion, a ſigne and ſeal of the Righteouſneſſe of Faith, and inward circumciſion of the heart to</hi> Abraham <hi>as a beleever, and to</hi> Abrahams <hi>children as children of a beleever: Otherwiſe, the Argument will not hold that beleevers and their children ſhould be baptized now, as well as beleevers, and their children were circumciſed then.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Whatſoever by vertue of Chriſts Inſtitution did agree to, and might be practiſed by all beleevers and profeſſors of Religion, and onely to beleevers, and children of beleevers at all time; after that Inſtitution of Chriſt in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, that was appointed by Chriſt to a beleever as a beleever, and to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of beleevers as children of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as being proper to them. But cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, that ſigne and ſeal of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Faith, and inward circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the heart did agree to, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:103743:117"/> might be practiſed by all beleevers, and profeſſors of themſelves to be beleevers of the true Religion, and onely beleevers and profeſſors of themſelves to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers. And all times ordinarily to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers and profeſſors of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and to their children; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore circumciſion, that ſigne and ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of Faith was inſtituted by Chriſt to <hi>Abraham</hi> a beleever as a beleever, and to the children of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Abraham,</hi> as children of a beleever. And ſo it may ſtill follow, that a ſigne and ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of Faith, though not circumciſion, yet baptiſm doth, and may agree to beleevers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and to children of beleevers, as children of beleevers now, as well as before the coming of Chriſt.</p>

                  </note> the Propoſition that is evident from the right of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which agreeth to all beleevers, and onely to beleevers, as at all times to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in the ordinary way, except it be obſtructed by extraordinary cauſes, as Circumciſion was in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:103743:118"/>
               <p>And for the ſecond, the Aſſumption that will appear, becauſe all beleevers or profeſſors of the Faith, and true Religion, were, or might be circumciſed if they would, though they were not of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> family:<note place="margin">Gen. 17.12, &amp;c.</note> Here is no prohibition of them, but a command if they were of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, whether children born in the houſe, or ſtrangers bought with money of any ſtranger, though not of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed; yet he muſt be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed if he come into <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, and ſo become a profeſſor of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and worſhipper of the true God; for which, the Lord did know that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> would inſtruct his houſhold after him.</p>
               <p>All theſe muſt be circumciſed as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers or profeſſors of beleef in God, and of the true Religion, and hope of et<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But unbeleevers, and ſuch as did not, nor would come in, and be true beleevers in the true God, and profeſſors of the Faith in Chriſt, the Meſſiah to come, they had no right to circumciſion, nor to any ſigne and ſeal of the covenant of Grace; and therefore the Aſſumption is true, that Chriſt did inſtitute Circumciſion, that
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:103743:118"/> ſigne and ſeal of the covenant to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers as beleevers, and to children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers as children of beleevers.

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, in <hi>Melchiſedech, Lot, Iob,</hi> and the reſt, we have no certain evidence that they were, or were not circumciſed, nor is it material. For it is certain, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumciſion before Chriſt, nor bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm ſince, or any outward Sacrament, was, or is, or can be rightly ſaid to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to Salvation; elſe <hi>Noah</hi> and other Patriarks before <hi>Abraham,</hi> might have been circumciſed, or have had ſome other ſigne and ſeal which we had not: and children dying before the eight day of circumciſion, or before they were baptized, could not be ſaved, which a Popiſh Doctrine well worthy to be exploded out of the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may be anſwered, That God did renew the covenant, and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute circumciſion as a ſigne and ſeal of the covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Church in his houſe, which was then the Church of God, chiefly viſible at that time in the world, conſiſting of above three hundred ſouls,<note place="margin">Gen. 14.18.</note> and then ſet forth by God as a Type of the Church of the faithful in all ages, who were to have the covenant of Grace publiſhed, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103743:119"/> doth not hinder, but that circumciſion, that ſigne and ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of Faith, was inſtituted to <hi>Abraham</hi> as a beleever, and to <hi>Abrahams</hi> children and family, as the children and family of a beleever. Men of ripe yeers, profeſſors of the true Faith and Religion, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as children of beleevers and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors: And ſo the like ſigne and ſeal, baptiſm may in like manner be continued in the New Teſtament, as well as in the Old, for any light that yet appeareth to be held forth from Chriſt to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 9. <hi>But is not Infants Baptiſm forbidden by Chriſt in the New Teſtament, either expreſly or by conſequence, in that Chriſt doth not name children in the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of baptiſm, as he did in the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of circumciſion?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Certainly there is no expreſſe prohibition of Infant baptiſm in the New Teſtament; yea, the Lord Chriſt is ſo far from forbidding of Infants any Grace and favours they are capable of,<note place="margin">Mark 10.13, 14.</note> that he reproveth his Diſciples for hindering their bringing unto him, though it was not in particular to be baptized, yet to receive a bleſſing from Chriſt; for which
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103743:120"/> cauſe, their beleeving parents or friends, did preſent them unto Chriſt, that Chriſt might take them in his arms, and put his hands upon them and bleſſe them (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving parents, do now preſent them to Chriſt in baptiſm.<note place="margin">Mark 10.13.</note>) And Chriſt receiveth them, and giveth for a reaſon, a high ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of children expreſſed in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Evangeliſts: <hi>Suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not; for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God.</hi> True, not onely of ſuch who in ſome reſpects are qualified like children, but of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons alſo, even of little children: And true, both of the Kingdom of Grace and Glory, for all elect children of Jews and Gentiles of all Nations. And if the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God belong to children, then why not this Seal of the Kingdom Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, of which, Infants are capable now, as well children at eight dayes old were capable of circumciſion, before the coming of Chriſt? It is evident, there is no expreſſe prohibition of Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, which may hinder their preſenting unto Chriſt, to be bleſſed in that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 10. <hi>But what ſay you to the ſecond? is not Infant Baptiſm denyed by

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Anſwer is: Firſt, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that Chriſt in that Inſtitution of Baptiſm, intends principally men and women of ripe yeers, Jews and Gentiles to be converted to the Faith of Chriſt, who were capable of teaching; and firſt to be diſcipled by teaching, and then bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized as the Proſelytes that came in to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Houſe,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.18, &amp;c.</note> no doubt were firſt taught before they were circumciſed, and yet their children were circumciſed at eight dayes old, before they were taught or made Diſciples by teaching, of which they were not capable. It is true,<note place="margin">Iere. 1.4, 5.

               <p>Queſt. 11. <hi>You have anſwered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:103743:121"/> the ſpiritual Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the elect children of beleevers, that they may be Diſciples by way of Covenant, and by right of Election; and ſo may have a right and intereſt to Baptiſm, the ſeal of the Covenant, which is not denied by ſome chief adverſaries of Pedobaptiſm, (if they could be known to be ſuch.) But now, what ſay you for other children of beleevers, which it may be, are none of Gods elect; nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples by way of that internal Covenant of Grace; nor inward ſanctification of the Spirit? What right or title can ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants have to baptiſm in infancy, or until they be diſcipled by publike Teaching, and Declaration, or profeſſion of themſelves to be beleevers, and converted to the Faith of Chriſt, and ſuch to be admitted by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Chriſts Inſtitution, Go, Diſciple all Nations, and Baptize, as is opened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, for all children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving Parents, though they be none of Gods Elect, yet I conceive they may have as good a priviledge now, and be under outward Adminiſtrations, as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> had, (if theſe were not elected) or as any of the beleevers children before Chriſt had, not being elected by way of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:103743:122"/> priviledge as children of beleevers, to partake of outward Ordinances and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges as children of the faithful, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when as it is not known of us who are elected, and who are not. Why may it not be, that <hi>Eſau</hi> was made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of this outward priviledge, for <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſake? And for the elect childrens ſake, all in general, who are children of beleevers in the Church of God, might, and may have this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward badge of Chriſtianity, as a note of diſtinction between children of Iews, Turks, and Pagans, who deny and reject Chriſt; and children of ſuch faithful, who beleeve and embrace Chriſt, and the Goſpel, in truth, and ſincerity.</p>
               <p>And thus you have one ground of Scripture opened and applyed for Pedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm, which may evidence, That it is not a meer humane invention, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute will-worſhip, as ſome have affirmed, whom I dare not for this one opinion againſt Infants baptiſm, utterly condemn, excommunicate, and caſt out of the Churches of Chriſt, as enemies to Chriſt and the Goſpel; but rather look upon ſome of them as weak Brethren, to be drawn in by bands of Love, and cords
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:103743:122"/> of Amity, by all means ſeeking to inform them, and reveal that light the Lord hath opened in the Cannonical Books of the Old and New Teſtament, praying God, that every Saint may joyn in love and humility, in prayer to God every day more and more, to reveal and ſettle Truth in his Churches, that God may be glorified, and truth, and peace eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 12. <hi>I am of your minde not to condemn all as utter enemies to Chriſt, who are adverſaries to childrens baptiſm: But yet their Diviſions and Separations they have made in the Church, their unchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Churches of Chriſt, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Chriſts Miniſters for difference of Opinion, in things of leſſer importance, with divers ſuch like, cannot be anſwered, or juſtified, I think, before God or men, as being contrary to that Chriſtian love, and unity required by Chriſt, in, and amongſt all that profeſſe the Name of the Lord Jeſus. But tell me I pray you, what other grounds of Scripture have you to prove the lawfulneſſe of childrens Baptiſm?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There are divers Grounds of Scripture diſcuſſed, and handled at large by ſeveral learned men. I will onely
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103743:123"/> name a few, and leave the more full open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, to thoſe who have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the controverſie in their larger Treatiſes.</p>
               <p>And firſt, That encouragement which the Apoſtle giveth to thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,<note place="margin">Acts 2.38, 39.</note> to repent, and be baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins, becauſe the Promiſe is to them, and to their children, and not to them onely and their children, but to as many as are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhould call, that is, to the faith of Chriſt, or to be beleevers in Chriſt; and why not to their children alſo, as being children of beleevers, as well as to the former, whether they were far off of the Iews, or far off of the Gentiles, who ſhould be, or are ſince brought in to beleeve on Chriſt? and ſo their children have an encouragement to be baptized, as well as other. If you ask what the promiſe here ſpoken of, was, I cannot ſee why it ſhould not be that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to beleevers in him, as being in ſome reſpect the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Faithful. I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed; and then as circumciſion was eſpecially the ſeal of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103743:123"/> that ſpiritual Covenant to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſpiritual Seed, ſo virtually to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and their ſpiritual children, is there a ſigne and ſeal belonging: And this is not circumciſion, which is vertually for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in that Inſtitution of Baptiſm by Chriſt in the Goſpel; as Baptiſm is,<note place="margin">Matth. 28.19, 20.</note> and may be vertually commanded to children of beleevers, though not expreſſed by Name in that Inſtitution of Baptiſm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid. In like manner, as women are not expreſſed by Name in the Inſtitution of the Lords Supper, and yet are ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually by Chriſts Ordinance to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and made partakers of that holy Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 13. <hi>But may not there be the ſame Arguments for the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to be given to children of beleevers now, as for the Sacrament of Baptiſm, ſince the children of the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to eat the Paſſeover,</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I conceive there is not the ſame Reaſon of Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper. For in the Act of Baptiſm, both men of ripe yeers, and children, are meer pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, ſuffering themſelves to be baptized, which a childe is capable of, and may
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103743:124"/> ſuffer, as well as a man of ripe yeers. But in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper there is action, not onely of eating and drinking, for that a childe may do. But of eating and drinking in remembrance of Chriſt, of ſhewing the Lords death until he come, of offering up an Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtical Sacrifice, of praiſe and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, for the death and paſſion, and Reſurrection, and Aſſention, of Chriſt, and all benefits thereby, and an Act of renewing our Covenant with God in Chriſt at the Sacrament, which an Infant cannot do,<note place="margin">N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is not the outward dipping or waſhing that clenſeth away ſin; but the vertue of the blood of Chriſt: And we read no abſolute command of Baptizing in a River, or waſhing the whole body in water; nor do we believe the Iaylor and his houſhold (Baptized at midnight) went forth to a River to be dipped all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: It is ſufficient to Baptize or waſh part, as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter</hi> in waſhing the Diſciples feet, He that is waſhed needs not have to waſh his feet, but is clean every whit: For if Chriſt waſh
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:103743:129"/> any part of the ſoul or body with his blood, he waſheth the whole man,<note place="margin">Ioh. i.7. Rev. 5.6. Ioh. 13.8, 9, 10.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is evident to me, that they reſted too much in the work done, and outward action, Chriſt giving no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for ſuch a threefold baptizing of the body; and I conceive the like of baptiſm of ſome Adverſarie to Poedobaptiſm in a River, (too much magnifying the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the outward action, of their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of their whole body of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized Diſciples:) For which kinde of Baptizing the whole Body, or Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing in a River,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.19.</note> Chriſt gives no word of command that we finde in Scripture in the Inſtitution of Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 25. <hi>You have held forth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:103743:130"/> grounds from the Word of God, to ſhew the lawfulneſſe of Baptizing the chil-of Believing Parents: But I deſire the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of another doubt. Do you believe I pray you that there is ſuch a neceſſity of Baptizing children, that if they die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baptiſm they are damned, or go to Limbo, as the Papiſts dream, and too many Popiſhly affected amongſt us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, I believe Baptiſm is not a thing indifferent to be uſed or not uſed at pleaſure: but it is neceſſary to be uſed of Chriſtians according to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Mat. 28.20.</note> And if it cannot be obtained by men of ripe years converted, or for children of Believers; yet it is to be ſought for and deſired in a right and due manner, with the Word adjoyned unto it, not reſting on Baptiſm, but on Chriſt for Salvation. And yet I do not believe that outward baptiſm makes a Chriſtians ſoul,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.15.</note> or Baptiſm to be ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly neceſſary to Salvation, or the Grace of God in Chriſt to be ſo tied unto the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that thoſe who deſire it, and die without it, cannot be ſaved; or that they go into ſome Limbo, and not into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as Papiſts and ignorant people have dreamed: Or that believing Parents
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:103743:130"/> ſhould be ſo troubled for their children dying without Baptiſm, as if they were loſt; but rather to live by Faith,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.</note> that as God is their God, ſo he is the God of their Seed, and can ſave them as well without Baptiſm as with Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 26. <hi>But what ground have you for this your Faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have ground ſufficient out of the Word of God. For firſt, it cannot but be a ſin againſt Chriſtian charity, to judge all thoſe children of Patriarks, and people of God before the birth of Chriſt, who died before the eight day of circumciſion to be damned, or be ſent to Limbo for that want of circumciſion, which by the Law of God they might not have until the eight day. Secondly,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.12.</note> or to think all thoſe who dyed in the wilderneſſe (in the forty years) uncircumciſed to periſh, when as there was a kinde of neceſſity by occaſion of their often removing that they could not have circumciſion until they came to <hi>Canaan.</hi> Thirdly,<note place="margin">Ioſh. 5.2, &amp;c.</note> or to think the ſame of children of Chriſtian Parents, who died before the Feaſts of Paſſeover and Pentecoſt, at which times Baptiſm was then uſed in the Church. Fourthly, or to think of the Believing
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:103743:131"/> Repenting Theef upon the Croſſe,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.5. &amp; 4. &amp; 7.</note> that he was damned for want of Baptiſm. If theſe had the Baptiſm of the Spirit, the living vertue of that water of life; that was a ſeal of their entrance into Gods Kingdom, though they wanted the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Baptiſm of water.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 27. <hi>What concluſion do you make from all this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Therefore I conclude of theſe or ſuch like children or others, as <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> did of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour, who coming to be Baptized died by the way,<note place="margin">Ambroſe lib. de vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian.</note> they are Baptized <hi>voto,</hi> though not <hi>facto,</hi> in will and deſire, though not in fact, in reſpect of outward Baptiſm, yet they may partake of the inward Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. And ſo Chriſtian Parents need not to be tormented with grief for want of Baptiſm in private, when God is pleaſed to deny publike,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.</note> but be comforted, and not to ſorrow as thoſe that have no hope, for their children they hope are aſleep in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Qu. 28. <hi>I will touch but one Quaere more: Hath not Infant Baptiſm been very much abuſed in the Church? And if ſo, Is it not better to take it away, as the Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent was, by which means the abuſes may
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:103743:131"/> be ſure to be Reformed, which otherwiſe can very difficultly be Reformed, many groſſe abuſes being ſo rooted in the hearts and mindes of ignorant men, yea, of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of men and women in the world?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It cannot be denied but that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſm hath been moſt groſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed by erroneous opinions and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the Church, yea almoſt even from the beginning that we read of it in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Writers, as that it conferred grace, that it was neceſſary to Salvation, that without Baptiſm Infants were at leaſt in danger to periſh, that outward Baptiſm did make an Infant a Chriſtian ſoul, and having Baptiſm, it was made a member of Chriſt and the childe of God, and certainly ſaved, though the Parents were unbelievers, Pagans or Infidels, or as bad. Theſe erroneous abuſes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others, not only in Popery and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Churches at this day, but even in <hi>England</hi> amongſt multitudes of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious formal and ignorant people, both in the city and countrey, as we may finde by ſad experience, witneſſed by many Arguments of wilful ignorance, or much weakneſſe at leaſt, and much to be pitied and lamented, and prayers put up to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:103743:132"/> God it may be amended.</p>
               <p>Beſides the multitude who reſt in this outward Ordinance of Baptiſm in their Infancy, as <hi>Paul</hi> did before his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in outward Iewiſh priviledges, and in ſpecial that he was circumciſed the eight day,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.6, 7, 8.</note> all which he accounted nothing but loſſe for Chriſt, when God once opened his eyes to ſee his folly of truſting to theſe outward priviledges of being circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, or partaking of the Paſſeover or any thing but to Chriſt himſelf and his Righteouſneſſe: multitudes now truſting to this, That they were Baptized, made Chriſtian ſouls in Infancy, and have been houſholded, and received Sacrament at leaſt once a year at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> or it may be every moneth, although they did never make profeſſion of Faith, or partake of inward Baptiſm, Regeneration, or new Birth,<note place="margin">Iohn 3.3, 5.</note> without which a man cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. Secondly, although they were never brought to ſee their extreme need of Chriſt, or carryed out of themſelves, and all ſelf-confidence or truſt to outward Ordinances and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon priviledges of Baptiſm, the Lords-Supper, form of Godlineſſe, Religious duty, or the like, all which a man or
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:103743:132"/> woman may partake of,<note place="margin">Luk. 13.24.</note> and never have any dram of that true Grace which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth ſalvation, or be admitted en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Kingdom of Glory.</p>
               <p>Thus far certainly; and worſe it may be, hath Infant Baptiſm been abuſed in the Church. Nevertheleſſe, if Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm be judged lawful by vertue of that Inſtitution of a ſeal of the Covenant by Chriſt to believing <hi>Abraham,</hi> not of the corporal or c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rnal part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the promiſe of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Poſterity: But alſo the ſpiritual part to believing <hi>Abraham</hi> and his children, and to Believers and their children, as children of Believers, as a ſeal of the Righteouſneſſe of Faith, or by any other ground or Argument held forth already, or to be held forth by any the Servants of Chriſt. Then I conceive the abuſe of Baptiſm doth not take away the lawful uſe.</p>
               <p>But if the Apoſtle approve circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> children;<note place="margin">Acts 21.21.</note> and <hi>Paul</hi> circumciſed <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 16.3.</note> becauſe he would not offend the <hi>Iews,</hi> although circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was to be aboliſhed. Ahd if after he had Preached, that if they were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed Chriſt profited them nothing,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.2.</note>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:103743:133"/> (as he did to the <hi>Galatians</hi>) yet if a <hi>Iew</hi> ſhould have been converted to the faith, and the year before his converſion, had a childe received circumciſion as his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, and the next year after his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to Chriſtianity, have had a childe which might not have been circumciſed, becauſe aboliſhed, and troubled that his childe might not be Baptized, nor have any outward badge of difference from the childe of an Infidel; becauſe, as Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to <hi>Poedobaptiſm</hi> aver, there's no Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Chriſt for Infant Baptiſm: I conceive Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would have Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the <hi>Iews</hi> childe, to take off the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as well as circumciſed <hi>Timothy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſince no direct command of Chriſt appears to the contrary. And ſo, though Infant Baptiſm could be proved fit to be left, as circumciſion was aboliſhed; yet till men were enlightned, it might be continued as circumciſion; and much more now be practiſed in the Church, ſince it cannot be proved to be forbidden or aboliſhed. And thus you have the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for Infant Baptiſm moderately.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 29. <hi>Now to conclude, What may all this teach us which you have ſet forth concerning Childrens or Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:103743:133"/> that (as you have ſaid even now) although it had been aboliſhed as circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was, which it was not, yet it might be continued untill mens mindes were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, as circumciſion was continued for a time; and much more now be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Church, ſince it cannot be proved to be any where forbidden by Chriſt, but rather approved; and ſince there are ſuch different and doubtful opinions of it in ſuch as profeſs to be Saints, how ſhould Saints behave themſelves one to another in the Church of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Truly this may be a light from Chriſt, to lead us unto Chriſt, and learn from Chriſt and his Apoſtles not to un-Church the Churches of Chriſt Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and yet reforming for this difference of Poedobaptiſm and ſuch like, as ſome virulent and unchriſtianlike Adverſaries to Infant-baptiſm have done, and yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to do: But to labour for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, rather then unlawful Schiſm and Separation from the Church. Thus ſhall we declare our ſelves to be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans indeed, not ſeeking diviſion, but in a Chriſtian Brotherly way endeavouring Union and Unity, and Peace in the Church, each one labouring for a true

                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:103743:162"/> Seed, the Faithful or beleevers, and compleated by a ſigne and ſeal of this Covenant in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his children, and all that ſhould come in to be of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, and ſo mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, and to their children at eight dayes old, as to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and all <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſterity.

               <p>Queſt. 20. <hi>But howſoever, there was and might be a Covenant between God and</hi> Abraham; <hi>and ſo between men of ripe yeers, and the Lord mutually. Yet how could there be a Covenant between God and</hi> Abrahams <hi>young children, or the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of other beleevers when they were circumciſed, Whereas they were but eight dayes old, and Circumciſion in the ordinary way to be deferred no longer: And how were theſe admitted into the Church by Covenant and Circumciſion, the ſigne and ſeal of the Covenant of Grace, between God and</hi> Abraham?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, The Covenant or Promiſe on Gods part, or by the Lord, was with <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, and in and with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> to and with the children and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving poſterity of <hi>Abraham:</hi> And all

               <p>Secondly, As on <hi>Abrahams</hi> part,<note place="margin">Gen. 12. Gen. 17. Rom. 4.11.</note> the Covenant was mutually made with God by himſelf, in taking the Lord for his God as he had done before by beleeving the Promiſe, That in him, that is, in his Seed Chriſt, ſhould all the nations of the Earth, be bleſſed, renewed here again, as expreſſed more fully in and by accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of, and ſubmitting unto circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the ſigne and ſeal of the Covenant of Grace, and of the righteouſneſſe of Faith in Chriſt the Meſſiah to come: and ſo by men of ripe years, Proſelytes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to be of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, by profeſſing themſelves covenanters, and to have the Lord for their God, and by accepting of and ſubmitting unto circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, that ſigne and ſeal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as, <hi>Abraham</hi> did.</p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:103743:163"/>
               <p>But for children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of other Proſelytes, believers who had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred Covenant for themſelves; <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and ſuch Parents did in all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance Covenant that they would inſtruct and teach their children the Covenant of God which the Lord witneſſeth of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 18.18, 19.</note> that he did know <hi>Abraham</hi> would do according to his duty and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that they might fear the Lord, which is certain was no more then what <hi>Abraham</hi> had engaged himſelf unto by his Covenant, accepting the Lord for his God, and the God of his ſeed.</p>
               <p>And the Infants themſelves did only paſſively enter Covenant (if I may ſo ſpeak) by receiving circumciſion the ſigne and ſeal of the Covenant, which they were actually to enter by ſolemn profeſſion, when they came to be of knowledge and underſtanding; as thoſe children of the Iſraelites did, of which we read <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the tenth:<note place="margin">Neh. 10.28, 29.</note> When they were inſtructed and catechized in the knowledge of the myſtery and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of circumciſion, as the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites children were commanded to be inſtructed in the myſtery or Sacrament of the Paſſeover &amp; Law of God,<note place="margin">Exo. 12.26, 27.

               <p>Queſt. 21. <hi>Then it ſeemeth that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion did not give Infants at eight dayes old a compleat and perfect admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into the Church or a perfection of memberſhip with viſible profeſſors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I conceive they had a true and compleat Infant admiſſion as far as they were capable of, and paſſively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſigne of circumciſion, as a ſigne and ſeal of that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> their Father, to diſtinguiſh them from the children of all Pagans and Idolaters, ſuch as were not of the Church, and to intitle them to other rights and priviledges, which they ſhould be capable of when they came to knowledge and underſtanding to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, and by profeſſion actually to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Covenant themſelves.</p>
               <p>But they were not fully and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken as ſuch viſible members, as might joyn in Covenant and other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, until they were of knowledge and underſtanding, as is noted in <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> before.</p>
               <p>For I do not conceive it certain that children were admitted to eat the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:103743:164"/> until they were of ſome underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, if that be true which is related by the Hebrews, that every one both of men and women was bound to drink that night, four cups of wine without fail, every cup containing a log, as much as an egge and half, and to bleſſe God at every cup, eſpecially at the laſt cup, As Maſter <hi>Ainſworth</hi> out of <hi>Maimon</hi> relates, to which the Apoſtle alludes in the cup of bleſſing; beſides, they were to be of that underſtanding to ask their Parents the reaſon of that ſervice,<note place="margin">Exo. 12. 1 Cor. 10.16.</note> and to conceive their inſtruction given them as appeareth from that 12 of <hi>Exod.</hi> noted before: Therefore more then Infant-circumciſion was neceſſary to a compleat grown up viſible member of the Church before Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 22. <hi>You have ſhewed in part the admiſſion of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and men of ripe years of</hi> Abrahams <hi>poſterity or children were admitted as members: now in what manner were the Proſelytes admitted when they were received as of the Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is recorded in Scripture that one Ordinance was to be for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation and for the ſtranger that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed with them; as they were, ſo were

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:103743:165"/> Covenant, as in the 5, 6, 7, 8. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a fore going in that Chapter, is evident: Thirdly, by ſacrifice, as it is written, he ſent young men of the ſons of Iſrael which offered burnt offerings, and this at entring into a confirming of the Covenant: For <hi>Moſes</hi> took the Book of the Covenant and read in the audience of the people,<note place="margin">Exo. 24.5, 6, 7, 8.</note> and they ſaid all that the Lord hath ſpoken, we will do, and be obedient; here was a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Covenant, and <hi>Moſes</hi> confirmed it by ſprinkling the blood on the people, and ſaid, Behold the blood of the Covenant which the Lord hath made with you concerning all theſe6 words: And ſo in all ages, when an Ethnick or Heathen was willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Covenant, and gather him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the wings of the Majeſty of God, and take upon him the yoak of the Law, he muſt be circumciſed and baptized, and bring a ſacrifice; and if it be a woman, ſhe muſt be baptized, and bring a ſacrifice; and as the Iſraelite, ſo was the admiſſion of a ſtranger alſo, by way of Covenant profeſſion and ſeal of Covenant, as is held forth by theſe evidences.</p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:103743:165"/>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For outward admiſſion into the viſible Church of Chriſt, ſince Chriſts Aſcention: This was and is by way of Covenant alſo, though in a different manner of diſpenſation, as it reſpects di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers perſons, and times of admiſſion, or at leaſt of approbations of perſons admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as viſible compleat members of the Church, and fellowſhip of the Saints, fit to partake and communicate in al Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Acts of fellowſhip, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.

               <p>Queſt. 26. <hi>What was the firſt way or practice of the Church in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the Ordinance of Chriſt?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, Inwardly men of ripe yeers, Jews or Gentiles converted, or profeſſing themſelves to be converted by the preaching of the Goſpel, to beleeve in Chriſt, were admitted as members of the Church, and into or for this admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there was.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As there was or ſhould have been a beleeving or faith in Chriſt, true and ſincere, or at leaſt temporary; in which the ſoul did cloſe or ſeem to cloſe with Chriſt, and Covenant and agree to receive Chriſt for a Saviour,<note place="margin">Act 8.13 and 8 37 Pſa. 27.8</note> according to the promiſe and tender of the Goſpel. And this was a kinde of union, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſecret covenanting with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord Chriſt ſpeaking inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſoul in kindneſſe; O poor ſoul, wilt thou ſeek my face, and have me for thy Lord, and Husband, and Saviour: Behold, I have loved thee,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> and given my ſelf for thee.</p>

               <p>Secondly, Outwardly there was, firſt an inchoation or degree of entrance and admiſſion into Church fellowſhip, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring of Baptiſm, the Seal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Chriſt, and the Members of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Acts 8.16.</note> the head of his Church, as the Eunuch did deſire to be baptized.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There was an open profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Faith, and internal Covenant, and union with Chriſt the Head of his Church by beleeving; and ſo inwardly, or by that inward bond of the ſpirit and ſaith with all Chriſts members, and an open Declaration, and holding forth of this Faith of Chriſt, and beleef of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church; or thoſe who had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from Chriſt to admit, and receive into Church fellowſhip, as viſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip in the Church.<note place="margin">Acts 8.37.</note> This <hi>Philip</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of the Eunuch when he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or deſired Baptiſm.</p>

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:103743:169"/> what letteth but that I may be baptized?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Philip</hi> Anſwereth, if thou believeſt with all thy heart, thou mayſt.</p>

               <p>Here was two things, firſt, a holding forth of the truth of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Secondly, of his belief and aſſent thereunto, and ſo a receiving of Chriſt and a hearty-covenant with Chriſt, which moved him to deſire Baptiſm, as the ſeal and Sacrament of the Covenant, and of admiſſion into the Church, and of Communion with the Saints.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In this profeſſion of Faith and declaration of a willingneſſe to and deſire of Baptiſm, the ſigne and ſeal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace in Chriſt (as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was before) is implied a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we have and do actually Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Chriſt: And (as it was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi>) as the Lord ſayes ye are my people;<note place="margin">Zac. 13.9</note> ſo Gods people alſo ſay the Lord is our God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt ſaith to the ſoul thou art my ſpouſe,</p>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:103743:170"/>
               <p>Secondly, and the ſoul ſaith to Chriſt thou art my Lord my loving Husband: And ſo though not in ſo many words outwardly, yet in ſubſtance in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in the heart, and profeſſion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith with the mouth and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to be baptized, is an entrance by way of Covenant or witneſſing, that the party deſiring Baptiſm hath entred Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God in Chriſt, which he now deſired to be ſealed, and his admiſſion to be compleated in Baptiſm. 4ly. A Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is entred and ſealed in Baptiſm with the Head Chriſt and all the members of his myſtical Body, the party thus confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and profeſſing Faith and Covenant; when the Church or perſons authorized by it that did finde that according to Chriſts inſtitution,<note place="margin">Act. 10.47.</note> he or ſhe had jus <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem</hi> a right unto Church-fellowſhip and to Baptiſm, the ſeal of admiſſion, yea, a kinde of inward right in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſpiritual memberſhip of Saints in Chriſt the Head (as far as in judgement of charity they could diſcern) thus admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt, this profeſſor of the Faith I ſay was baptized, and ſo outwardly compleated, and entertained as a Church member; not only to the Sacrament of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:103743:170"/> the Lords Supper and breaking of bread,<note place="margin">Act. 2.46.</note> but alſo to all other Acts of Church fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip which agree to a member by the Ordinance of Chriſts ſealing in Baptiſm both his Covenant with God in Chriſt, and with all the members of Chriſts my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Body: And thus you ſee how men of ripe years converted from Iudaiſm, or Paganiſm to the Faith and holineſſe of the Goſpel, had their outward admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into the Church and Communion of the Saints with Chriſt their Head, and one with another: And ſo far you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Scripture way of admiſſion into, or making up the Body or Church of Chriſt: Thus there were dayly added to the Church ſuch as ſhould be ſaved,<note place="margin">Act. 2.47. 1 Cor. 12.27.

               <p>Queſt. 26. <hi>How then may a viſible Church of Chriſt be deſcribed by this that you have held forth?</hi>

               <p>Queſt. 27. <hi>I like of this deſcription if you make the matter of a viſible Church to be viſible Saints as you ſeem to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</hi>

               <p>Queſt. 29. <hi>But if this Diſcipline be wanting?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Simile.</hi> Is it a Chriſtian courſe, when two or three are ſick or faln lame in a Family, to forſake the houſe without taking care, or affording help and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for recovery of a brother, ſiſter, or fellow ſervants: How will the father or maſter of the family take this; certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if a murderer muſt be deſtroyed when the great King Chriſt ſhall come to judgement; Theſe that kill in not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to ſave life, ſhall not eſcape unpuniſhed, except in time God open their eyes, and in and by Chriſt,<note place="margin">Acts 5.32.</note> give them repentance; let ſuch then repent, and return, and aſſiſt in Reformation, not go on in Separation from the Church.</p>

               <p>Secondly, to inform them how they have likewiſe promiſed to do their beſt endeavour to inſtruct them in their duty (when that they come to years and have gain'd knowledge and Faith, by Gods Grace in the Goſpel) to make profeſſion of that Faith, and declare their ſubjection in their own perſons unto the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and to renew the Covenant of which paſſively they received the ſeal when they were baptized in infancy, and to declare their renewing of that

               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, to inſtruct them that they were baptized and engaged in Baptiſm, to this end amongſt others in this or the like manner to enjoy a more full Communion in and with the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And thus I have endeavoured to ſet forth the manner and nature of Infants outward entrance and ſolemn admiſſion with the Church by Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is another thing to be conſidered in and concerning the children of believers, when they are come to years of underſtanding and knowledge; and that God hath given them Faith and holineſſe in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ability to profeſſe their Faith, and to declare their deſire of holineſſe and willingneſſe to manifeſt their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed ſubjection to the Goſpel in Faith, and obedience: This is their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this duty, by means whereof they are admitted by the Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, or thoſe who have Authority
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:103743:176"/> from Chriſt unto a full Church communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and other acts of Church-fellowſhip, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the rule and direction of Chriſt, held forth in the Goſpel: And thus I conceive they are formally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat members, as in reſpect of truth, of memberſhip-infant, in their infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, ſo in reſpect of viſibility and ripe years memberſhip in the Lords Supper, and thus they all are viſible members and matter of the Church of Chriſt, and have a true formal admiſſion into the Church without any other ſpecial Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant amongſt Chriſtians as neceſſarily and abſolutely neceſſary to the formal conſtitution of a viſible Church, and without any rebaptization or renouncing of their former Baptiſm, as ſome have and do pretend. And thus I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you who are our neighbours, and what is the Church of Chriſt viſible and the Communion of Saints to and with whom we ought to exerciſe our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an love and charity: And ſo the true matter of a Church or material cauſe both in reſpect of infants and men of ripe years.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 35. <hi>But ſir there are divers
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:103743:177"/> Separatiſts amongſt us, who are ſeducing people dayly from our Church, and affirm our Churches have neither matter nor form of a Church, or at leaſt are ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in both, that our congregation are no Churches of Chriſt; but Babylon and members of Antichriſt and ſo to be depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>They do indeed abuſe that place of Scripture, and falſly apply that to us which belongs to</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But I have given an Anſwer to this Objection before in part: Yet to clere the point more fully in brief: Firſt, for the matter of the Church they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, but we have in our Church and Congregations viſible Saints true matter of a Church and members of Chriſt, yea, ſome as great Saints as moſt we know or reade of in the Chriſtian world: This I my ſelf have known in ſome Country Parochial Congregations by experience, and this I do know in ſome great City Congregations; although there be too many hypocrites, too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny formaliſts, and too many prophane People mixed, and not yet purged out from our Congregation, nor caſt out as they ought to have been: And I ſay further, if for theſe failings and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:103743:177"/> in a Church, They will as they would un-church our Churches, they may and do by the ſame Argument un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which Chriſt and his Apoſtles approve and acknowledge true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God in Chriſt Ieſus: If for this cauſe of different matter of or in our Churches, or becauſe we have mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Congregations, and not conſiſting of all viſible Saints, but ſome erroneous in judgement, and ſome erring in life and converſation; their Argument I conceive muſt be to this or the like effect, as full againſt the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> as our great mixed Congregations. No viſible Church which is a mingled Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſiſting of ſome viſible Saints and ſome viſible prophane people in life, and erroneous in judgement, ignorant and ſcandalous, and not caſt out, but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Church, is a true viſible Church of Chriſt and to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with: But the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was ſuch a Church (as well as our mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Congregations, as may eaſily be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) And therefore the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> was no true viſible Church of Chriſt, and to have beep ſeparated from
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:103743:178"/> as from <hi>Babylon.</hi> And this I hope they dare not but confeſſe is a moſt falſe and ſcandalous concluſion; and ſo their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument falſe againſt our Churches, and their opinion, a falſe opinion that our mixed Congregations are no true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt, or to be ſeparated from as from <hi>Babylon</hi> it ſelf. The force and falſhood of their minor propoſition, will appear as it relates to our Congregations if we compare the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> and our great mixed Congregations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; we ſhall finde the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> and other Churches as corrupt and mixt as ours, and yet not un-churched by Chriſt or the Apoſtles. You may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe particulars.</p>

               <p>Ninthly,<note place="margin">2 Cor, 11.12, &amp;c.</note> They had in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> falſe Teachers, falſe Apoſtles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful workers, transforming themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt, as Satan changeth himſelf into an Angel of light, whoſe Miniſters theſe ſafe Apoſtles were, labouring by fair ſhew to ſeduce the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in <hi>Corinth:</hi> and yet the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth not un-Church <hi>Corinth,</hi> nor preſſe or give way to a Separation for all this.</p>

               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:103743:181"/>
               <p>Qeſt. 37. <hi>And what the reaſon of this, may ſome one demand?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There might be many reaſons given; but this one amongſt the reſt: Becauſe, although there were many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in that Church, both in life and Doctrine, yet the Word and Sacrament were continued, the prophane wicked men and Hypocrites, though they were in the Church, and taken as members, until they were diſcovered and tryed, and proved, and caſt out; yet they were not true members of the Church, nor true members of Chriſt, nor any true members of the Congregation, but in ſhew and outward appearance; They were amongſt the Saints, but they were not of the Saints, as <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, They were and are (indeed) of the world: they went out from us,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 2.18, 19.</note> but they were not of us; but they went out from us, that it might be known they were not all of us; they were with and in the Church, and yet they were not truly of the Church; And howſoever this corruption was, yet the Church did ſtill remain a true Church, and had many true Saints in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> although it had rotten and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt members, which by right courſe
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:103743:181"/> and execution of Diſcipline, ſhould have have been caſt out the Church. And thus for the Saints ſake, though the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> had falſe member, and corrupt members, and many Errors, both in life and Doctrine; yet the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth not un-Church the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> or give way to a Schiſm or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for all this.</p>
               <p>As a tree is a true tree although it have ſome rotten Branches:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Or as a ſick or wounded man is a true man, although he be ſick or wounded: So a Church of Chriſt may be a true Church, although it be ſick and weak, and wounded and full of imperfections, both in matter and form as the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> and other Churches of Chriſt have been, and yet eſteemed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles to be true Churches of Chriſt, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hold forth evidently unto us.</p>
               <p>Now compare the Church of <hi>England</hi> or the Churches of Chriſt in <hi>England</hi> collectively, though they be mixed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations; yea divers of our Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in <hi>London,</hi> and in the countrey, where faithful and painful Miniſters have been Preaching, Baptizing, Catechizing, calling to profeſſion of Faith and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:103743:182"/> and approbation before the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Lords Supper, where there hath been and is a communion of Saints (as I know there hath been in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places and mixed Congregations) compare, I ſay, theſe with the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and by the ſame Argument that theſe Seducers may or can Separate or un-Church our Churches, by the ſame the Saints or ſome of the Saints in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> might have ſeparated from their fellow Saints and Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> which yet would have been a ſin in them, as it is a ſin in theſe who ſeparate and labour to ſeduce and draw others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us to ſeparate from their fellow-Saints, and to un-Church or make rents and Schiſms, and diviſions in our Church, which is a grievous ſin againſt the Lord Chriſt, the Lord and Head of his Body the Church.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 38. <hi>But ſome will object, It may be that there is not the ſame condition of our Church of</hi> London, <hi>or any great mixt Congregation amongſt us in respect of the matter as there was of</hi> Corinth. <hi>For in</hi> Corinth <hi>it is moſt like that the greater part of the Church were Saints indeed, or viſible Saints in outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:103743:182"/> at leaſt. But in our mixt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, commonly the greateſt part vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ignorant, prophane, or ſcandalous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or but civilly honeſt, and formal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors at beſt; and ſo are not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Church of</hi> Corinth, <hi>no not ſo much as for the matter of our Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, Certainly men ought to be very careful, as not to un-Church a Church; ſo not to un-Chriſtian a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor for ſome failings in knowledge or practice.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 1 Pet. 4.8.</note> Charity covers many failings, and as the Apoſtle ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Corinth</hi> was a great city wd Church, and yet conſider the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and other faults, it is not certain which was the greater part, the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent or the faulty. But howſoever, grant that the Church were ſo decayed, that that the greater part had onely a name to live, and indeed were dead,<note place="margin">Rev. 3, 1, 2.</note> as is ſpoken of the Angel or Church of <hi>Sardis:</hi> Or that the greater part of the Church were grown Luke-warm,<note place="margin">Rev. 3.15, 16.</note> and ſuch as Chriſt threatens to ſpew out of his mouth, as the Church or Angel of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea:</hi> yet it may be a true Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for all this.</p>
               <p>A Buſhel of good Wheat in a Barn
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:103743:183"/> amongſt three or four or more Buſhels of chaff, is yet a true Buſhel of Wheat, though it be mixed with much more chaff then Wheat. Or, an Army of men, although conſiſting of more ſick and wounded Souldiers and Officers then whole, is yet a true Army though weak. And ſo is a company of Profeſſors of the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> enjoying a communion in Ordinances, holding the truth of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and profeſſing ſubjection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: Yet a true Church, when the greater part be the worſe, yea, both ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and ſcandalous; but yet a ſick Church, and ſtands in need of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. And thus is the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and our great mixt Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, true Churches for matter of a Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> was, and not to be ſeparated from or un-Churched for theſe coruuptions, as <hi>Corinth</hi> was not, whatſoever any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers in this reſpect oppoſe to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 39. <hi>But howſoever this may prove our Churches as true as</hi> Corinth <hi>was for matter; yet the Adverſaries of our Church deny our Churches to be true Churches in Form: And how will you

               <p>I will not ſtand to handle theſe at large, but touch them in brief.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for outward Form of union in
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:103743:184"/> reſpect of admiſſion into a Church, we have ſhewed how men of ripe years, Iews or Pagans, converted to the Faith, were admitted, firſt, after they had heard the Goſpel and believed; either with a falſe Faith as <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> or with a true Faith as the Eunuch; they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a union and admiſſion into the Church by Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Secondly, did make profeſſion of their Faith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, did intimate in this deſire of Baptiſm and profeſſion of Faith, their receiving of Chriſt to be their Lord and Saviour, and their Covenanting with the Lord to be his people: And,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, their ſealing all this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Baptiſm; the ſigne and ſeal of this Covenant between God and them, and ſo were formally admitted into the Church, and brought into a Church uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fellowſhip with the Saints: And this our Adverſaries confeſſe was a true form of admiſſion into the Church at firſt converſion: And this I ſay was right, for Iews and Pagans born out of the Church converted to the Faith of Chriſt; but it doth not follow, that becauſe it was the ordinary way for them: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:103743:184"/> the ſame order and form in every circumſtance, muſt be for thoſe who are born in the Church: for children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have a priviledge (as the children of believing <hi>Abraham</hi> had, and as we have proved already) above all the children of Pagans and Infidels out of the Church whatſoever.</p>
               <p>And yet the ſubſtance of this Form of admiſſion, is and hath been obſerved in the Churches of Chriſt; and ſo we may Juſtifie of our particular mixed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations (as they are called) that they are true Churches of Chriſt, in reſpect of outward admiſſion into the Church.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 40. <hi>But how do you make this to appear?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, children of believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, have according to their priviledge due to them, an infant admiſſion into the Church in Baptiſm; in which where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they themſelves cannot preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and deſire Baptiſm, that ſeal of the Covenant (as circumciſion was of old) I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed:<note place="margin">Acts 2.38, 39,</note> The Parents do preſent their children and deſire Baptiſm for them, as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant priviledge belonging to children of believers.</p>
               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:103743:185"/>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe the children can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not profeſſe their Faith: The Parents do profeſſe or declare their aſſent and conſent to the Faith of Chriſt, and truth of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe the children cannot intimate their Covenant with Chriſt: therefore their Parents do Covenant and promiſe to do their endeavour, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to catechize their children, and bring them up in the knowledge of Chriſt: but to do their endeavour, that the childe when he or ſhe ſhall be of years, and that God hath given knowledge and Faith, ſhall make a ſolemn profeſſion of the Faith of the Goſpel, and of their Graces and Faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Parents promiſe that they will do their endeavour, that the childe when called of God, and enabled with knowledge and Faith, ſhall not onely profeſſe Faith and Covenant, but deſire to renew and ſolemnly to enter Covenant with the Lord, and to ſeal it in the bleſſed Sacrament of the Lords Supper, after examination, profeſſion, and approbation of the Church: and thus the children of believers have a true infant admiſſion, and form of admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:103743:185"/> into the Church, and are true infant members of the viſible Church, ſo far as infant-memberſhip is or can be to them now, as it was to <hi>Iſaac</hi> at eight dayes old, and to all children of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Abraham</hi> before the coming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 41. <hi>But this is but an infant-memberſhip, which though true, yet it doth not Anſwer that admiſſion of men of ripe years in the Primitive Times?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Anſwer again, that when theſe children of believers baptized in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, are come to years of diſcretion; and God hath given them knowledge and Faith in Chriſt, and they have made profeſſion of their Faith and Graces of God in them, and deſire to enter Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſolemnly with the Lord, and to ſeal it in the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and upon examination, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Church, are formally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Miniſter of Chriſt and the Church and officers thereof: there are ſuch perſons made compleat viſible members called to be of Saints, and to the fellowſhip of the Saints in the Church of Chriſt: And of this perſon or perſons ſo admitted, I affirm that they
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:103743:186"/> have a true Form of admiſſion into the Church; and if their Faith and prfeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith be true and ſincere, they are as true members of the Church of Chriſt, as the Eunuch was; and if their Faith and profeſſion of Faith be but falſe and counterfet, as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his was, and too many have been in our Churches; yet a Church made up of ſuch members, is as true a Church viſible for our form of admiſſion, as any we reade of, was ſince the Apoſtles times. Let any man declare if he can, when and where a Church was conſtituted of ſuch as were born in the Church in a better form, for the firſt ſix hundred years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt:<note place="margin">None to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t before ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techized and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. See the Rubrick before &amp; at Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the old Book of Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-Prayer.</note> And therefore I conclude, that however many corruptions and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings have been in particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in the practical part of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; yet the Lawes of our Church did require both catechizing and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith, and approbation, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance after examination before admiſſion to compleat viſible ripe year memberſhip, and admiſſion to the Sacrament to renew covenant as aforeſaid; And thus our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are true in form, in reſpect of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward formal admiſſion into the Church ſubſtantially true, which is ſufficient.</p>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:103743:186"/>
               <p>Queſt. 42. <hi>This I think may ſatisfie for the form of admiſſion into a Church fellowſhip: When a man or woman born in the Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions,</hi> l. 4. c. 19.8.4. <hi>Ierome Contra. Lucifer.</hi> I would it were reſtored to its pure uſe.</note> 
                  <hi>a childe of a believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent baptized in infancy, is thus admitted when he or ſhe cometh to years, not by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh confirmation worthily aboliſhed, but by this ancient order of ſolemn profeſſion of Faith in Chriſt, and holineſſe and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, which learned Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr ſpeaks of noted before: And reverend Mr.</hi> Calvin <hi>commends, as moſt worthy to be reſtored in the Church to its pure uſe: But our Adverſaries deny our Miniſters Ordination, and affirm the form of their Ordination and admiſſion, or call to be Miniſters to be Antichriſtian, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Churches to be no true Churches of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, I Anſwer, that it is the opinion of theſe Adverſaries, that there is no need of Ordination of a Miniſter, onely for a particular Congregation to chuſe one of their fellow Brethren to be their Miniſter, or to have an approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a company of profeſſours to be their Miniſter, there needs no more, and then the Ordination of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as in the opinion of ſeparatiſts it
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:103743:187"/> doth not further, ſo it is certain it cannot hinder a man from being a Miniſter of Chriſt, if at any time he be called and approved of a Church, and whoſoever he be who renounceth his calling to the Miniſter, becauſe he was ordained by a Biſhop and a company of preaching Presbyters: I think in this as in other things, he is too ſuperſtitious and Popiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected, to an outward form of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and worthy to be cenſured of the Church for ſuch an errour; in which he condemns valiant <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Maſter <hi>Calvin,</hi> worthy <hi>Latimer, Cranmer, Ridley, Hooper,</hi> thoſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Miniſters and Martyrs of Chriſt; as if they were not true Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, becauſe ordained by a Biſhop and a company of Presbyters according to the ancient practiſe of the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſay the Miniſters of Chriſt have had a twofold vocation or calling to that office.<note place="margin">Acts 20.18, 18. and 13.1, 2, 3. 1 T t &amp; .4.14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, extraordinary by Chriſt Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as the Apoſtle and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had. And,</p>
               <p>Secondly, more ordinarily by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Elders of the Church, and by the laying on of the hands of the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:103743:187"/> Presbytery as the Scripture held forth unto us; as <hi>Paul</hi> left <hi>Titus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 1.3, 4. Act. 20.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> Biſhop <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> or overſeer <hi>Titus,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Biſhops or Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> far different from our late Biſhops or overſeers in many reſpects, &amp; the manner commonly by laying on of hands of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and a Biſhop or overſeer, not as a Biſhop of later ſtamp; but as a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter and overſeer of old, have Miniſters of Chriſt been ordained, and after ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſent and received of particular Churches: And howſoever ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions have crept into the manner of Ordination; and although ſome ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Presbyters have turned Popes and Popiſh Biſhops, and ſome Popiſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, with a company of Presbyters, have examined, approved, and ordained Miniſters, and given outward Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Authority to preach the Goſpel; yet this cannot nullifie the call of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt, if he be called and gifted inwardly and inabled by Chriſts ſpirit with gifts fit for the miniſterial office, as all the outward calling and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a particular Congregation, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not an illiterate cobler or other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick to be a true Miniſter of Chriſt
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:103743:188"/> when Chriſt hath not furniſhed him with gifts and graces fit for ſo high and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable a calling.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We who are Miniſters of Chriſt receive not our calling from <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> but from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and our Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſubſtance is truly Chriſtian, not Antichriſtian: Howſoever, ſome Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianly affected might ſometimes have had a hand in Ordination; the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath been conveyed to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, yea, to ſeparate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations themſelves, to ſuch as ſeparate themſelves from <hi>Babylon</hi> (it may be by the hands and means of Romiſh <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>) God hath made the ſervants of Antichriſt to be his ſervants in this, that they have been porters and carriers, to bring the holy Scriptures unto the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches by the hands of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reformers in the Churches of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and yet the Scriptures are the true Word of God, and the true Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for all this. And ſo are our Miniſters true Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> though their outward Ordination had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through the polluted hands of ſome Antichriſtianly affected Biſhops and Presbyters, who did ſit in place as
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:103743:188"/> Scribes and Phariſees did ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> chair. But we ſay further,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.1, 2, 3.</note> as God did extraordinarily call, and gifted the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Miniſters in the Primitive times, and they ordained others in the Church, whoſe Miniſtery the Lord did bleſſe for the propagation of the Goſpel. So did the Lord wonderfully ſtir up, and in an extraordinary manner call <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and others in the Reformed Churches: And ſo Reverend Biſhop <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer,</hi> and other god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Martyrs, Biſhops and Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by whoſe hand their ſucceſſors the faithful Miniſters in the Churches of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>England</hi> received their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ordination; but their inward from <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf and his ſpirit, by whoſe grace the Lord hath made our Miniſtery glorious in the converſion of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſouls to God, and building up of as glorious Saints as any ever was in the Chriſtian world, ſince the Primitive times; yea, even the Separatiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4 15.</note> who now deny us to be the true Miniſters of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> muſt needs confeſſe that we have been their ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Fathers in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and have begotten them again to God through the Goſpel;
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:103743:189"/> yea,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.19.</note> we as tender Mothers have travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in birth again in our painful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, until <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath been formed in them all, though now in a moſt ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner they diſhonour their parents, and ſin againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Lord of his Church.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 43. <hi>This I ſuppoſe is ſufficient to ſatisfie any humbled ſoul, not filled too much with pride, ſelf-conceit, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of diviſion and ſeparation, as too many are in theſe dayes: But yet ſome object, That howſoever Miniſters outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and ordination may be paſſed over, and they be lawful Miniſters; yet what lawful call have they to particular Congregations and places?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, Patrons of Churches and congregations were and have been honoured and truſted with the nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and preſentation of Miniſters to particular, Churches; but ſo as none ought to have been put upon any congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, but ſuch as ought to have been well approved of by the Biſhop (who had a truſt repoſed in him alſo) for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency and ability for the work of the Miniſtery, and for holineſſe of life and and converſation, which when and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:103743:189"/> where the truſt was rightly performed, and the Miniſters have been faithful la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in the Lords harveſt; and after admiſſion approved of by the faithful and godly party in a Parochial Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; certainly, there was a call ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and a ſufficient union and form of union between Paſtor and people, to make up in this reſpect a true Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Howſoever this truſt both in Patrons and Biſhops, hath been moſt groſly abuſed by corrupt Simoniacal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, moſt unconſcionably ſeeking to thruſt wicked Miniſters they cared not whom upon the people, and careleſſe Biſhops neglecting that truſt repoſed in them; yet the failings herein was not enough to un-church a Church, where yet the Goſpel hath been preached, and Sacraments adminiſtred for ſubſtance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the inſtitution of Chriſt, though here as in <hi>Corinth, Galatia,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> many faults might be found to ſtand in need of Reformation.</p>
               <p>And howſoever no face of a Church might for a time appear,<note place="margin">1 Kin. i9.14. Ier. 3.15.</note> as in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for a time: yet God in many places have given Paſtors after his own heart, to feed
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:103743:190"/> his people with knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and where the Candleſtick hath been removed for a time, or at leaſt a Candle ſhut up as in a dark lanthorn: God at prayers of his people, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved a careleſſe ſhepherd, and in his due time reſtored comfort in a faithful Miniſter to his people; and ſo ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and preſerved the Churches of Chriſt amongſt us, yea, both for matter and form ſufficient to conſtitute a Church, howſoever, there hath been ſome failings in both.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 44. <hi>You have in ſome meaſure cleared this Objection: Yet how are our Churches rightly conſtituted in reſpect of a formal union of members, one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I conceive there is a twofold union:</p>
               <p>Firſt, a civil union, as in diviſion of Kingdoms, Provinces, Cities, or Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes: And as God hath in this provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, united men in habitation and courſe,<note place="margin">Act. 17.26.</note> and means of livelyhood, God having determined the times before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and the bounds of their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: and in this civil co-habitation there is a union, and this civil union in
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:103743:190"/> a Kingdom, City, or Pariſh, or the like, doth not un-church a people for this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: for then certainly all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt in <hi>Corinth, Galatia, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Pergamos, Smyrna,</hi> and others, as well as in <hi>England, London,</hi> or a Parochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Congregation, muſt have been un-churched then, which, what is more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to imagine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is a religious and more ſpiritual formal union, when a company of men and women profeſſing the Faith of Chriſt held forth in the Goſpel and ſubjection thereunto, in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe, and united in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Church or congregational mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting place, to partake of the holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Word, Prayer, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and other acts of Chriſtian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and Church fellowſhip. This is a true form of a Church amongſt us though not without ſome failings, yet ſo as we have and do remain true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Ieſus Chriſt, and ſuch as ought not to be un-churched by ſchiſm and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 45. <hi>But how will this appear in particular?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I Anſwer firſt, for the preaching
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:103743:191"/> of the Goſpel and our union, in that we have had and do enioy a moſt comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table union and meeting of Chriſt, and one with another; even our Adverſaries being judges, they themſelves have found the ſweetneſſe of Chriſt, in the preaching of the Goſpel in our mixed Congregations by Gods faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: And although ſome Miniſters there preach otherwiſe, as in <hi>Galatia</hi> they do, yet not un-church a Church for all this.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for prayer, howſoever, ſet forms have been by ſome in Authority ſo much preſſed, yet if we look to the ancient form, preſcribed in the dayes of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt of happy memory; That was but a kinde of directory, as was evident in the Rubrick, and directions at the end of that Book, that liberty gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to uſe or not uſe in divers reſpects, as that in prayer, a man might knock his breſt, or not knock it, he might kneel or not kneel; in ordinance he might croſſe, or not croſſe, and divers other of like nature: yea, I conceive the late Book of Common-prayer, howſoever preſſed by ſome, yet was but a kinde of directorie, as in divers particulars is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:103743:191"/> in direction for viſitation of ſick, thanksgiving for womens deliverance from danger of childebirth, left to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of a Miniſter, and though preſſed by other; yet not un-church a Church for all this.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for the Sacrament and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of them, thoſe that object, that Chriſt did bleſſe, firſt, the Bread, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſtribution of the Bread, or parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of that, did then bleſſe the Cup, that we bleſſe them both together: This is but a circumſtance of time, and if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church a Church for this then, why not for changing the time of receiving from after ſupper, to the morning, or at feaſts of charity or the like: Theſe are weak objections to unchurch a Church, or to ſeparate from a true Church for any ſuch differences.</p>
               <p>I may ſay the like, to that of the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the bread, although the bread be cut and fitted for preparation; yet we conſtantly break the Bread in our admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the bleſſed Sacrament, as thoſe who joyn in communion with us know well.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 45. <hi>But they object, we admit ignorant and ſcandalous perſons, many
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:103743:192"/> times to the Sacrament, which ſhould be caſt out of the Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I Anſwer, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain concerning the inceſtuous perſon, all ſuch as are ignorant, and to be caſt out of the Church, when once they are diſcovered and proved to be ſo, not upon bare ſurmiſes onely; and this is that which alwayes ought to have been done by the Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> reade the old Rubrick in that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory or Book of Common prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and at the Sacrament, confirmed in the dayes of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt; and you may finde, firſt, that none ignorant ought to be admitted to the Sacrament, they muſt, firſt, be catechized and approved, before they be received to partake of that holy Ordinance: and ſecondly, none ſcandalous ought to be received, yea, if there have been or be but a controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie between two parties, any malice or hatred, the Miniſter ought, firſt, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the parties, and to perſwade to charity, and admit the penitent, and reject the uncharitable; and howſoever, this duty may have been neglected, yet this failing is not a ſufficient ground to un-church a Church, or to ſeparate from
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:103743:192"/> a Congregation preſently for all this: elſe might the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and other Churches of Chriſt have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched as we noted before.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 46. <hi>But what power of Diſcipline hath there been in particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>that there might have been a power of Reformation in theſe things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, Certainly there was a great power in the Miniſters of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregations, eſpecially joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Church-Officers, who were ſworn to aſſiſt in Execution of Diſcipline; and further, although there was a power taken to the Biſhops in the great matter of Excommunication and ſuch like cenſures; yet not the Biſhop nor any under him, had any lawful power to Excommunicate any, inflict any cenſure until they were firſt preſented by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter or Church-officers of the particular Congregation: Nor was any man taken notice of as Excommunicate or ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Sacrament, until the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was Declared in the particular Congregation; and thus, There was a power of Diſcipline in particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, although it was many times
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:103743:193"/> obſtructed, and not put in due Execution as it ought to have been; yet for all this it had ſufficient to declare and point out a form of a Church, and to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute and continue a true Church for all this.</p>
               <p>Look to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> noted before: Look to the Church of <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,</hi> where Diſcipline was obſtructed, the Church and Church-Officers ſuffered thoſe who taught the Doctrine of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 2.14, 15.</note> and the Doctrine of the <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laitans,</hi> which Chriſt hated, and yet a true Church for all this, though corrupt and unſound in this reſpect. Look to the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> Chriſt complained againſt them, that Diſcipline was not exerciſed,<note place="margin">Rev. 2.20</note> they ſuffered the woman <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabel;</hi> yet Chriſt doth not un-church them, nor direct any ſeparation from them for all this: And ſo our Churches are true Churches both for matter and form, and not to be un-churched, or any ſeparation; but a Reformation to be ſought for, and true unity in the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 47. <hi>Yet once again; Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever formerly there hath been a matter and form of a Church; yet now the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:103743:193"/> form is gone, and the Church like an old houſe, pull'd down to be new builded; and where and what form of a Church have we now, until Diſcipline and a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be ſetled in the Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, Our Church is now in a hopeful way of Reformation (bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God) but yet it is not like a houſe wholly pull'd down to be new builded; there are onely ſome few rooms pull'd down, where the Officers for execution of Diſcipline lodged, and ſome ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: But the main houſe ſtands ſtill, the preaching of the Goſpel as glorious as ever, the Word, and Prayer, and the Sacraments, and admiſſion and growth of grace in the Churches of Chriſt, yea, even in our mixed Congregations, and ſo ſtill true Churches, for matter and form, and viſible Saints to be found, to and with whom we may exerciſe this grace of chriſtian love and charity.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 48. <hi>This is enough, I conceive, to ſhew our lawful memberſhip in and of the Church of Chriſt; and to evidence our Church a true Church, in reſpect of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the fellowſhip of the Saints, and communion of the faithful, both for matter and form: But now wherein ſhould
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:103743:194"/> a childe of God declare and ſhew forth his Chriſtian love and charity to ſuch viſible Saints and members of Chriſts Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In all lawful chriſtian union and communion one with another in actions of piety and charity, according to the rules of the Goſpel, edifying one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the knowledge of Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the weak brethren in all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, humility and love, to build them up in the neceſſary truth of the Goſpel, and that in all godly prudence, to win them to a more high prizing of Chriſt and all the wayes of Grace and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: but not receiving weak brethren or ſiſters to doubtful Diſputations,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.1, 2, &amp;c.</note> ſo much as in things indifferent, and ſo not in matters of higher nature, they being not able to judge of the force of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in diſpute,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.4.6.</note> and vain jangling (too common in the world) and ſo may be drawn to Errors, have their conſciences remain leſſe ſatisfied in the truth:<note place="margin">Acts 2. &amp; 5.</note> but to exerciſe all love towards them, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Miniſters to the flock, ſatisfying tender conſciences out of Gods Word, and one chriſtian communicating to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in outward things, eſpecially to the poor in the Churches of Chriſt; not
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:103743:194"/> that there is ſuch a community of goods,<note place="margin">Rev. 2.</note> and of all things, as the wicked <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laitans</hi> did,<note place="margin">Acts 2.</note> and ſome of later times do imagine, by wrong interpreting Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; but that in chriſtian charity the richer chriſtians ſhould be careful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the neceſſities of their poor Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and do good to them, eſpecially as being of the houſhold of Faith.<note place="margin">Gal. 6.10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And this is enough to manifeſt the truth of members of particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations that were baptized in Infancy, and Catechized, and profeſſing Faith, holineſſe, and renewing Covenant with God in Chriſt, before their partaking of the Lords Supper, as according to the true ancient order of the Church they have been in many Congregations Parochial in <hi>England,</hi> where faithful Miniſters have been; and not onely in this reſpect, but in reſpect of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Word and Sacraments, and effects of grace wrought in the hearts of Gods children, evidence our Churches true Churches, whatſoever violent ſeducing Separatiſts whiſper to their deceived Diſciples to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Thus you may ſee a communion of Saints in <hi>England,</hi> to whom, and with
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:103743:195"/> whom we may exerciſe our chriſtian love and charity,<note place="margin">Ier. 15.19.</note> which every day will ſhine more gloriouſly, as Reformation ſeparates the precious from the vile more fully; which we hope and pray for daily.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 4.3, &amp;c.</note>Fourthly, You know Satan tempted the Son of God to grievous ſins, to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; to diſtruſt of Gods Providence, to doubt whether he were the Son of God or not, (as your friend doth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe be Gods childe) yea, to pride, to vainglory, nay, which is more, to lay violent hands upon himſelf, and deſtroy his own life, by caſting himſelf down headlong from a Pinacle of the Temple, and when the Devil left him it was but for a ſeaſon.<note place="margin">Luke 4.13.</note> And if Chriſt was tempted ſhe muſt not deſpair in temptation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe is tempted, but reſiſt Satan by the word as Chriſt did,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.8, 9.

               <p>Queſt. 5. <hi>You have given a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection how to ſeek to Chriſt in times of temptations: But what ſhall ſhe do in her doubtings, concerning her Election, that ſhe may be ſure that ſhe is one of Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and choſen ones, and hath life of grace in her ſoul, as called of God in Chriſt to glory?</hi>

               <p>As the Sun riſing is known by the light approaching, the fire by the heat, and the tree by the fruits; ſo Election that prime grace, by the effects or ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent graces that follow, the Apoſtle holds this forth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30. whom God did foreknow with the knowledge of approbation, them he did Predeſtinate, whom he did Predeſtinate, them he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, whom he calleth, them he juſtifieth, whom he juſtifieth, them he glorifieth. Now begin at <hi>Calling,</hi> the firſt link we can take hold on, and if ſhe be inabled by the power Chriſt, to ſee her effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling from darkneſſe to light, and

               <p>Queſt. 7. <hi>This may be a means by the power of Chriſt to ſtay her ſoul from despair in that temptation: But what do you ſay to her decay in grace? What light have you from Chriſt to reveal any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to her ſoul in this reſpect?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſay the Apoſtle gives a caveat to his Chriſtian <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.19.</note> to take heed of quenching the ſpirit; and yet no doubt they had the ſpirit of grace in them, but they muſt be careful not to quench the ſpirit; Gods dear children may be in danger to quench the ſpirit
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:103743:225"/> for a time, and may loſe the acts and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of grace for a time, as <hi>Peter</hi> did when he denied Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. (though not finally and totally) therefore if your friend finde ſome decay of grace in her ſoul, or want of holineſſe, ſhe ought not to conclude preſently ſhe is none of Gods childe, or exclude the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God in Chriſt from her. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, as there is no wheat but there is ſome chaff groweth with it; ſo the beſt of Gods children have ſome imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12, 13.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In this life we are not like the Sun, perfect in brightneſſe and light, but like the Moon, receiving our light of grace from Chriſt, as the Moon doth her light from the Sun, and like the Moon,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 1.8.</note> we are ſubject to have ſome changes, ſome decreaſe as well as increaſe, ſome ſpots of darkneſſe in the center of our hearts. And,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, take this for a certain rule, as ſight and ſenſe of weakneſſe of body is a ſign of bodily life (for a dead man feels nothing) ſo a ſight and ſenſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual weakneſſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.15, &amp;c.</note> is an evident argument of ſpiritual life of grace in her ſoul, as it was in bleſſed <hi>Paul.</hi>

               <p>As it is not the hand that receiveth the Plaiſter, and apply eth it to the ſore;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but the Plaiſter it ſelf, and the vertue of that, with Gods bleſſing, that healeth the wound.</p>
               <p>So though faith be an inſtrument or hand to receive Chriſt, and ſo an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental cauſe of Juſtification; yet it is Chriſt and his merits and righteouſneſſe
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:103743:229"/> that is the meritorious cauſe, and that which giveth true and full peace to the ſoul.</p>
               <p>And this reſt on Chriſt will prove a glorious reſt in the end, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.10.</p>
               <p>And therefore if your friend do but ſee the day light or renewing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quickning grace begin to dawn in the ſoul, if but a wiſhing for the day (as <hi>Pauls</hi> company in that long and ſad night on the Sea of danger, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.29.) let her wait on Chriſt in his Ordinances, and take her to the ſure word of Gods gracious promiſes, until the day light of grace dawn, and the day ſtar of joy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in her heart, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19.</p>
               <p>If ſhe finde any hunger, though but a weak ſtomack, like a man or woman new recovered, or recovering from ſome long and tedious ſickneſſe; yet let her weak ſoul, almoſt fainting for lack of Chriſt, as ſorrowful for her former failings, yet hungring after Chriſt, and rejoycing at Chriſts invitation, draw near to Chriſts Ordinances, the Word Preached, and Sacraments adminiſtred, waiting to ſee the face of her beloved the Lord Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Cant. 5.8</note> that ſhe may tell him ſhe is ſick of love, and be revived with the light of

               <p>Queſt. 13. <hi>This indeed may hold forth that promiſe that Chriſt made at his laſt Supper, and the inſtitution of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before his Paſſion, and which he did promiſe and fulfil when he died for us: But how can the ſame words be a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental pnomiſe to you who deſire to come to the Lords Table?</hi>

               <p>Secondly, As the Apoſtles in the firſt Inſtitution and participation of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament did by faith feed on Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.24, &amp;c.</note> which was then promiſed to be given to be crucified for them, and drink of his blood which was then promiſed to be ſhed for them, and of which they were aſſured by that word of Chriſts promiſe; even ſo likewiſe I now being a believing, humbled, hungry ſoul, do now by vertue of the ſame promiſe of Chriſt, who hath performed and ſealed, now in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what he promiſed, Receive aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that Chriſt hath given his body to

               <p>And thirdly, by the ſame Sacramental promiſe I am now aſſured that I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all the vertue, merits and efficacy of the body and blood of Chriſt, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for aſſurance of my Juſtification, ſanctification and ſalvation, as aſſuredly as if I had been preſent when Chriſt ſpake thoſe words, or made that promiſe to his Diſciples; or that I did now hear the bodily voyce of Chriſt now ſpeaking unto me from heaven by the ear of my body, as he ſpeaks to the ear of my body by his Miniſter, and now ſpeaks to the ears of my believing ſoul by the voyce of his ſpirit, perſwading and enabling me to believe the truth of theſe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental promiſes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Therefore I conclude, that I may eat and drink at this Table to my joy and comfort; Now I may be aſſured that Chriſt gave his body to be crucified, and his blood to be ſhed for my ſins, or that he loved me and gave himſelf for me.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 15. <hi>What now is to be acted by you when you hear and ſee the Sacramental promiſes held forth unto you?</hi>

                  <p>So it is with the light of Chriſt, when he cometh into a darkned ſoul, he dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth out the darkneſſe of error, and light of truth ſhineth in the place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: He driveth out the darkneſſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, when a ſoul walketh in darkneſſe and ſeeth no light; yet when the light of Chriſt cometh ſhining into a ſoul, and revealing the light of Divine truth incloſed in the promiſes, the ſparks of faith which were as it were raked up in the Embers, they are kindled, and the flame of faith ſhineth as a light, with joy and peace in believing; yea, Chriſt brings the light of joy to a troubled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.7.</note> and peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>And how then is the light of Chriſt precious: How is it to be reſted in as ſatisfactory above all other lights what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever? And how ſhould every ſoul that liveth and walketh in darkneſſe, draw nigh to Chriſt for light, for he lightneth every man that cometh into the world; all that receive light, they do and muſt receive it in and through Chriſt, whether light of Juſtification, or light of Sanctification, or light of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I conſider three things.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I conſider the day, the Sabbath day or day of Reſt, the Reſt-day, a day of ceaſing from our owne works as God did from his.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I conſider another duty, namely the end to remember the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Reſt day, or ſeparating and ſetting it apart from common and ordinary workes, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne this preſent naturall life, and a Conſecrating of it unto God and to holy ſpirituall workes, ſuch as concerne our ſpirituall life; and theſe things

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, a permiſſion; and in this the equity of this Commandement, as a ſtrong reaſon or motive to obedience; ſix dayes ſhalt thou labour and do all thy worke.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a Commiſſion or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to worke; for ſince God made all the ſeven dayes, as he did all the Trees of the Garden,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.16, 17.</note> and as hee might have forbid our firſt Parents halfe the Trees, or all but on e if he had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and that without any wrong to them, yet did forbid them but one Tree of the Garden; So the Lord might have forbidden us to worke in three or foure of the dayes or more, yea in all but one day. And therefore ſince hee reſerveth but one whole day of Seven for his ſolemne worſhip; Great cauſe we ſhould yeild moſt willing obedience to this Commandement, and be carefull to keepe this in a holy reſt to the Lord. and yet not miſpend the ſix dayes but
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:103743:303"/> worke in our lawfull callings.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I conſider a declaration of of the Lords right in this as being the Lords own ſeparated day in a ſpeciall manner, and therefore a ſtrong reaſon that man ſhould not prophane this day but keepe it holy. This in the next words, But the Seventh day is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the Lord thy God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I conſider a more generall and full prohibition of all manner of work; In it thou ſhalt do no manner of worke, that is, of thy own workes for which I have allowed thee ſix dayes to labour in.</p>

               <p>Queſt. 8. <hi>But wherefore then is not the Seventh day from the Creation kept as a Sabbath day, or by what authority is this Seventh day now ſanctified and kept as a Sabbath called in Scripture the Lords Day?</hi>

Epheſs. 2.12.</note> it is a ſinne in Maſters and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes to neglect Prayer, and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing their Families; and not to teach and inſtruct their houſholds in the way of God; when men or women, or their houſhold live as without God in the world; and their Families are uncate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized in their duties to God or to them;<note place="margin">Gen. 18.19</note> for what God commends in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> the contrary he diſliketh in thoſe who neglect the duty, and merit curſe.<note place="margin">Jerm. 9.25.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Deut.24.14.</note> not to governe the houſhold, and ſervants with Juſtice, and equity; but with unquietneſſe, Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and oppreſſion, is a ſinne;<note place="margin">Prov. 11.29.</note> ſuch a one is a troubler of his own houſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 4.1.</note> to command the Servant
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:103743:341"/> that which is unlawfull and againſt the Law of God, is a ſinne; if a Maſter, and Miſtreſſe command a Servant to ſteale, it is ſinne to command,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.15.

               <p>Sixthly, the Maſter and Miſtreſſe ſin in correcting their Servants,<note place="margin">Exod. 21.20.</note> and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices immoderately, indiſcreetly, with violence, paſſion, cruelty forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the rule of Chriſtian moderation,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.9 Prov 9.21:</note> with threatnings worſe then preſent moderate correction, and Cockering a Servant is a ſinne; as dangerous ſet on the other hand.</p>

<pb n="685" facs="tcp:103743:371"/> more full aſſurance of the forgiveneſſe of all thy ſinnes, and of Gods free grace and love unto thee in the Lord Jeſus; thou wanteſt many favours from God for thy body, for thy ſoule, for this, for a better life, for thy wife, thy husband, for Parents, children, ſervants, kindred, accquaintance, thy Neighbours, thy friends, thy enemies; for the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, for the Parliament, the Kingdom, the City and Country, for Peace and Truth, and a happy union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion one with another, and with the whole Church of Chriſt; and here expreſſe thy minde as well as thou canſt by the power of Chriſt; the Lord ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not ſo much for fine words as for an honeſt ſincere contrite heart, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by the ſpirit of Chriſt, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.2.</p>

                  <p>Queſt. 33. <hi>What rule is there to finde this out?</hi>

                  <p>Queſt. 34. <hi>But did you ever know any man thus learne to pray?</hi>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes, did I know a Chriſtian who could reade never a word upon the Booke, and yet after hee had received theſe directions puting them carefully and conſtantly in practiſe, in a ſecret place before God, the onely ſearcher of hearts and the Teacher of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, hee did in a ſhort time attaine an excellent habit in Prayer; and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to pray dayly in his Family, in a ſweet comfortable manner; and aſſuredly the Lord is the ſame God ſtill to all his children in Chriſt, and will be ſo to all, who diligently waite on
